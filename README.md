# My Undergraduate Projects

## 1). 22 Shrutis Synthesizer [[Link]](https://github.com/deepcpatel/Undergraduate_Projects/tree/master/22_Shruti_Synthesizer)

**Motivation :**
The usual electronic synthesizers use 12 notes in an octave. However, Indian classical musicians are fastidious about minor frequency variations, and therefore prefer "22 Shruti (Notes)" in an octave. Thus, in most cases, musicians have to take support from an external entity to tune their instruments as there is an absence of such electronic synthesizers in the market. With this in a view, an initiative is taken to build a "22 Shruti Synthesizers", having a capability of generating 22 Notes.
(In the Indian Classical Music, Shruti is a jargon for the musical note)
<br><br>
**Progress :** Till now, we have successfully implemented a software version of the synthesizer on Scilab and in Python. We have created two versions of the synthesizer. The first version synthesizes the frequencies using re-sampling of the recorded sound note, and in the second version, we synthesized frequencies using additive synthesis. We analyzed primary frequency components of the instrument tone using Fourier Transform and added their harmonics along with proper envelope to synthesize various frequencies. However, the sound quality is not reasonable for professional musicians, and hence, we are looking for an alternative approach to synthesize musical instrument sounds of better quality using Generative models like [NSynth](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/nsynth). Apart from this, we are also working to create a standalone synthesizer using RaspberryPi and MIDI Keyboard.

**Course : Wireless Communications**<br>
In this project we tried to reproduce the paper titled ["A nonparametric approach for spectrum sensing using bootstrap techniques"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7036915/).

## 3). Analysis of Traditional and Real Time CPU Scheduling Algorithms [[Link]](https://github.com/deepcpatel/Undergraduate_Projects/tree/master/CPU_Scheduling_Algorithm_Analysis)
**Members : [Shreyas Patel](https://github.com/shreyaspatel25), Deep C. Patel, [Maunil Vyas](https://github.com/Maunil), Karan Patel**<br>
**Course : Operating Systems**<br>
In this project we have done analysis on the Traditional CPU Scheduling algorithms like First Come First Serve(FCFS), Shortest
Remaining Next(SRN), Round Robin(RR), Priority Scheduling(PS) as well as Real Time CPU Scheduling Algorithms like Rate Monotonic Scheduling(RMS) and Earliest Deadline First(EDF) algorithms. We analyzed and compared characteristics like Average Waiting Time, Average Turnaround Time, Throughput and Percentage of Deadlines Missed.

## 4). Delta Search Machine: A Desktop File Search Engine [[Link]](https://github.com/deepcpatel/Undergraduate_Projects/tree/master/Delta_Search_Machine)
**Members : Deep C. Patel, [Maunil Vyas](https://github.com/Maunil), [Shreyas Patel](https://github.com/shreyaspatel25), Jay Dangar**<br>
**Course : Data Structures and Algorithms**<br>
We made a desktop file searching using Java. We perform serch on the index of the files in the Desktop. For the indexing task, we utilized [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) data structure. Our Searching engine features GUI, Search History, Recommendations and Spell Corrections.

## 5). Voice Calling system based on Voice Over Internet Protocol [[Link]](https://github.com/deepcpatel/Undergraduate_Projects/tree/master/VOIP_Phone)
**Members : [Maunil Vyas](https://github.com/Maunil), Deep C. Patel, [Shreyas Patel](https://github.com/shreyaspatel25), [Mihir Gajjar](https://github.com/GajjarMihir)**<br>
**Course : Computer Networks**<br>
Made a soft phone application. It features voice calling and conference calling facility with reasonable audio quality.
The application was built on python using PJSUA library. Asterisk Server was used to manage the clients.
<br><br>

## 6). Smart Shop Prototype [[Link]](https://github.com/deepcpatel/Undergraduate_Projects/tree/master/Smart_Shop_Embedded_System)
**Members : Deep C. Patel, [Maunil Vyas](https://github.com/Maunil), [Shreyas Patel](https://github.com/shreyaspatel25)**<br>
**Course : Embedded System Design**<br>
In this project we developed a smart shop prototype, which featured automatic collection of the items from the racks and multiple customer handling in the shortest possible time. The customer has to upload the shopping list into the system using console, after that our system would collect the items in shortest possible time. The system was controlled by ATmega 32 micro-controller and the program for it was written in C programming language. Moreover, the User Interface was written in Python.
<br><br>

## 7). Simulation of MIPS Processor on FPGA [[Link]](https://github.com/deepcpatel/Undergraduate_Projects/tree/master/MIPS_Processor_FPGA)

**Course : Computer Organisation**<br>
In this project, we simulated MIPS processor on FPGA using Xilinx Framework.
<br><br>

## 8). Synthesis of Harmonium Sound using various DSP techniques [[Link]](https://github.com/deepcpatel/Undergraduate_Projects/tree/master/Harmonium_Sound_Synthesis)
